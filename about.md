    <h2>About</h2>
    <p> Hi! I'm Victoria Nicchi, an architect student from University of Buenos Aires. I offer architectural & design services including architectural plans & drawings, 3D modeling & visualization, and design development. I'm proficient in AutoCAD, Revit, SketchUp, Rhinoceros, Lumion, & Adobe Suite. I create detailed, high-quality designs with a focus on art & architecture. </p>
    <p>I collaborate with my clients to create perfectly humble homes.</p>
    <p>My design is purposeful, producing work allied with the notions of 
       reductivism and beautility. The needs of my clients are heavily 
       embedded in the outcomes. Let's work together!</p>
