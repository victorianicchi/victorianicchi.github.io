  <h1>Services</h1>
  <p>
    As a multidisciplinary architect and designer, I offer an array of services 
    to bring your vision to life—balancing aesthetics, sustainability, and practicality.

  <div class="service-block">
    <!-- You can add an image here, e.g. <img src="{{ '/assets/images/service1.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Conceptual Sketch" /> -->
    <h2>Concept &amp; Schematic Design</h2>
    <p>
      From brainstorming sessions to initial sketches, I help you explore innovative 
      concepts that respond to your unique project goals. My schematic designs 
      incorporate modern styles, natural light, green solutions, and flexible floor plans 
      to adapt seamlessly to your lifestyle or commercial needs.

    <h2>Technical Drawings &amp; Documentation</h2>
    <p>
      With a keen eye for precision, I develop comprehensive architectural drawings 
      that adhere to building codes and regulations. I work closely with structural 
      engineers, MEP consultants, and other specialists to ensure the design is 
      both beautiful and code-compliant. Detailed documentation and 3D BIM models 
      allow you to visualize and refine every aspect before construction begins.

    <h2>Interior Architecture &amp; Renovation</h2>
    <p>
      Whether you’re updating a single room or reimagining an entire building interior, 
      I offer renovation solutions that blend functionality with modern design. From 
      material selection and lighting strategies to space planning, I make certain 
      every interior environment is both stylish and livable.

    <p>
      My work prioritizes environmentally conscious approaches. From passive 
      solar design and high-efficiency HVAC systems to eco-friendly materials and 
      water conservation strategies, I integrate sustainable solutions at every stage. 
      Together, we’ll create spaces that support a healthier future for both people 
      and the planet.
